## Business Analyst Dataset EDA

## Objective

The objective of this project is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Business Analyst dataset to gain insights and understand the characteristics and relationships within the data. This analysis aims to derive valuable patterns and trends that could assist job seekers in the field of Business Analysis.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from Kaggle.com. It is available in the "BusinessAnalyst.csv" file.


## Questions to Explore

1. Salary Analysis:
   - What is the distribution of average salaries?
   - How do salaries vary across different states and job positions?
   - Are there any noticeable relationships between job titles and salary ranges?

2. Geographical Insights:
   - How are job opportunities distributed across different states?
   - Are there specific states with higher job availability or salary ranges for Business Analyst roles?

3. Ownership and Sector Analysis:
   - What are the most prevalent types of company ownership in offering Business Analyst positions?
   - Are there particular sectors or industries more inclined to hire Business Analysts?

4. Rating Analysis:
   - How are job ratings distributed across different locations and sectors?
   - Is there any correlation between job ratings and average salaries?


## Steps Involved in Data Cleaning and EDA

1. Data Loading and Preliminary Overview:
   - Loading the dataset using R.
   - Initial inspection of data structure and summary statistics.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Identifying and extracting mismatched rows.
   - Fixing incorrect data formats and removing unnecessary information.
   - Handling missing or incorrect values.

3. Feature Engineering:
   - Splitting the salary column into minimum, maximum, and average salary.
   - Converting the 'Rating' column to a numeric data type.
   - Extracting geographical details from the 'Location' column.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Visualizing the salary distribution through histograms and box plots.
   - Analyzing job counts by state and ownership type through bar charts.
   - Exploring sector-wise distribution and its relationship with ratings and salaries using box plots.
   - Creating advanced word clouds to identify prevalent job titles.
